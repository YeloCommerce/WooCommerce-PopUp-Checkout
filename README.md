# WooCommerce-PopUp-Checkout
This two-step WooCommerce Pop-Up checkout plugin is developed with a primary focus on seamless payment processing. 
The checkout process will be WooCommerce-integrated and will encompass the following detailed steps:

## Step 1: Customer Information
The first step of the checkout process is dedicated to collecting essential customer information. Users are prompted to input their Name, Surname, Email, and Phone Number, ensuring a personalized and tailored shopping experience.

## Step 2: Secure Payment with WooCommerce
In the second step, our WooCommerce-based payment system takes center stage. Users can confidently complete their purchases by providing Credit Card Information, including the Card Number, Expiry Date, and CVC Code. This integration ensures the utmost security and reliability in financial transactions.

### Product Recommendations:
Enhancing the shopping journey, our plugin includes a product recommendation feature. Two handpicked products are showcased, complete with editable product descriptions. This empowers users to customize their selections based on individual preferences.

### Total Charge Display:
Transparency is key, and our plugin excels in providing it. The total charge, inclusive of selected items and any applicable shipping fees, is prominently displayed. This transparent breakdown allows users to review costs before finalizing their purchases.

### Effortless Trigger:
The entire checkout experience is initiated with a click of the 'Buy Now' button on our website. This triggers an aesthetically pleasing and seamlessly integrated POP-UP, ensuring a smooth transition from product exploration to secure checkout.
